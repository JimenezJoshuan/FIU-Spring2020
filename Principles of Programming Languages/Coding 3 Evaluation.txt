Coding 3 Evaluation

For this coding set, the work done was challenging compared to the first few sets. I developed the code over many days in order to fully understand the concepts
being asked in each problem. Most of these problems were very challenging in their own ways, but the problems I had the most difficulty with were 16 and 17.
They required a lot of time to be done and to understand the material. The rest of the problem set was still challenging, but was a matter of time and
patience to be able to do it.

Overall, the coding set provided a decent challenge that allowed me to keep on practicing my F# skills while also helping me view the class in a different way.
